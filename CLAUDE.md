This project uses the Open Agent System to transform research topics into comprehensive interactive web experiences. The agent system handles everything from web research to article writing to visualization creation to final webpage generation.

## Quick Start

To run the full pipeline:
> "Research [topic] and create an interactive webpage"

To use individual agents:
> "Research [topic]" - Research only
> "Write article from research" - Article creation
> "Validate images" - Check/fix image URLs
> "Create visualizations" - Generate charts
> "Generate webpage" - Create final HTML

## Available Agents

See `open-agents/INSTRUCTIONS.md` for the complete agent catalog and routing logic.
