# Research Notes: Autism and Vaccines - A Comprehensive Analysis of Scientific Studies

## Executive Summary

The question of whether vaccines cause autism has been one of the most extensively studied topics in modern medicine. Following a now-retracted 1998 Lancet paper by Andrew Wakefield that suggested a link between the MMR vaccine and autism, the scientific community conducted dozens of large-scale studies involving millions of children across multiple countries.

The overwhelming scientific consensus, supported by over 25 major epidemiological studies, multiple meta-analyses, and systematic reviews from organizations including the WHO, CDC, IOM, and Cochrane Collaboration, definitively concludes that vaccines do not cause autism. Neither the MMR vaccine, thimerosal-containing vaccines, nor the overall vaccine schedule has been found to increase the risk of autism spectrum disorder.

This research compilation examines the major studies, their methodologies, sample sizes, statistical findings, and validity assessments.

## The Origin: The 1998 Wakefield Study (Retracted)

### Study Details
- **Authors**: Andrew Wakefield et al.
- **Publication**: The Lancet, February 1998
- **Sample Size**: 12 children
- **Claimed Finding**: Suggested link between MMR vaccine and "autistic enterocolitis"

### Why It Was Fraudulent
- Data was falsified and manipulated
- Children were recruited through anti-vaccine lawyers
- Wakefield had undisclosed financial conflicts of interest (paid by lawyers planning lawsuits)
- 3 of 9 children reported as having regressive autism did not have autism at all
- Medical histories were altered to fit the hypothesis

### Consequences
- Partially retracted in 2004
- Fully retracted in 2010 by The Lancet
- Wakefield struck from UK Medical Register in 2010
- Led to measles outbreaks in UK and Ireland due to decreased vaccination rates
- Described as "perhaps the most damaging medical hoax of the 20th century"
