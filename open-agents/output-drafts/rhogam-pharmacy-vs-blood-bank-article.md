# RhoGAM: Should It Be Housed in the Blood Bank or Pharmacy?

In 1968, a revolutionary medical breakthrough transformed obstetric care: the introduction of RhoGAM (Rh immune globulin) reduced the devastating impact of hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn by over 80%. Today, this life-saving product prevents approximately 10,000 fetal deaths annually in the United States alone. Yet behind the scenes of every hospital, a seemingly mundane question creates significant operational and safety implications: **Should RhoGAM be stored and dispensed by the blood bank or the pharmacy?**

This question has sparked debate among hospital administrators, blood bank directors, pharmacy leaders, and accreditation surveyors. Some Joint Commission surveyors have told hospitals that RhoGAM "must" be under pharmacy control, while AABB standards explicitly require the transfusion service to maintain RhIG policies. The answer, as this evidence-based analysis reveals, is nuanced—but the scientific data strongly supports blood bank management as the safer and more effective approach.

## Understanding RhoGAM: More Than Just Another Medication

### What Is Rh Immune Globulin?

Rh immune globulin (RhIG), sold under brand names including RhoGAM, MICRhoGAM, Rhophylac, WinRho, and HyperRHO, is a plasma-derived biologic product containing concentrated anti-D antibodies. It is manufactured from human plasma collected from Rh-negative donors who have been immunized with Rh-positive red blood cells. This product prevents Rh-negative mothers from developing antibodies against the Rh-positive blood cells of their babies—a condition that, if left untreated, can cause severe anemia, brain damage, or death in subsequent pregnancies.

The standard 300-microgram dose of RhIG can neutralize up to 15 mL of fetal red blood cells (equivalent to 30 mL of whole fetal blood), providing protection for approximately 21 days. Administration is typically recommended at 28 weeks of pregnancy and again within 72 hours of delivering an Rh-positive infant.

### The Historical Impact of RhIG

Before the introduction of RhIG, hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN) was a major cause of fetal and neonatal mortality. Prior to 1945, approximately 50% of all fetuses with hemolytic diseases died of kernicterus or hydrops fetalis. The global incidence of HDFN was estimated at around 1% of all pregnancies, with a mortality rate approaching 50%.

The development of RhIG represents one of medicine's greatest preventive success stories. Since its introduction in 1968, combined antenatal and postpartum prophylaxis has achieved approximately **99% effectiveness** in preventing maternal sensitization. The incidence of Rh-hemolytic disease has declined by 80-90%, and mortality rates have dropped by two-thirds.

## The Regulatory Landscape: Classification Confusion

### FDA Classification

RhoGAM occupies a unique regulatory space. It is licensed under Biologics License Application (BLA) 103777 and regulated by the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER). Critically, RhIG is regulated under **21 CFR Part 640 Subpart J** (Immune Globulin Human)—not under Part 606, which governs blood and blood components.

This distinction matters because it classifies RhIG as a **plasma derivative** rather than a blood component. Plasma derivatives, like other immunoglobulin products (IVIG), albumin, and clotting factors, are manufactured through fractionation processes from large donor pools and undergo viral inactivation. In contrast, blood components (whole blood, red cells, platelets, plasma) are prepared from individual donations with minimal processing.

### AABB Standards: Clear Assignment to Transfusion Service

The AABB (formerly American Association of Blood Banks) Standards for Blood Banks and Transfusion Services provide the most explicit guidance on institutional responsibility:

**Standard 5.30**: "The transfusion service **SHALL** have a policy for Rh Immune Globulin prophylaxis."

**Standard 5.30.2**: Requires testing for D antigen before RhIG administration.

**Standard 5.30.3**: "The transfusion service shall ensure that the appropriate dose of Rh Immune Globulin is administered."

These standards use mandatory language ("shall") and explicitly assign policy responsibility to the transfusion service—not the pharmacy. Notably, a recent survey found that approximately 50% of US AABB-accredited institutions may not have comprehensive RhIG policies, suggesting significant compliance gaps.

### Joint Commission: The Source of Confusion

The Joint Commission classifies RhIG as a "blood derivative," which by their definition places it in the category of "medications." This classification has led some surveyors to state that RhoGAM must be under pharmacy control.

However, the official Joint Commission position, clarified by representative Megan Sawchuk, is unambiguous:

> "No, this is NOT a mandatory practice. Rho Immune Globulin is a 'blood derivative'... [JC] surveys these products under EITHER Immunohematology standards OR Medication Management standards." — Megan Sawchuk, Joint Commission

This means hospitals have flexibility in their approach, and neither blood bank nor pharmacy management is mandated by the Joint Commission. The organization will survey RhIG management under whichever departmental standards apply based on institutional policy.

## The Case for Blood Bank Management

### Critical Testing Requirements

The strongest argument for blood bank management centers on the **mandatory testing that must occur before RhIG dispensing**. Unlike most medications, RhIG requires laboratory verification before administration:

1. **Type and Screen**: Must confirm the mother is Rh-negative
2. **Antibody Screening**: Must verify the patient is not already sensitized (has not formed anti-D)
3. **Cord Blood Testing**: For postpartum administration, must confirm the infant is Rh-positive
4. **FMH Testing**: For postpartum patients, may require fetal-maternal hemorrhage quantification

<!-- VIZ: flowchart - RhIG Administration Workflow
DATA:
Steps:
1. Order placed for RhIG
2. Type and Screen performed (Blood Bank)
3. Verify mother is Rh-negative
4. Check antibody screen (no existing anti-D)
5. If postpartum: Test cord blood for infant Rh type
6. If infant Rh-positive: Perform FMH screening (Rosette test)
7. If Rosette positive: Quantify FMH (Kleihauer-Betke or flow cytometry)
8. Calculate appropriate dose
9. Dispense RhIG
10. Verify patient identity
11. Administer within 72 hours
12. Document lot number and administration
SOURCE: AABB Standards, institutional policies
-->

The blood bank performs all of these tests. When RhIG is stored in the pharmacy, there is an inherent disconnect: pharmacists must rely on communication from the blood bank about test results, or clinicians may attempt to order RhIG before testing is complete.

### Dosing Expertise: More Complex Than Standard Medications

For most postpartum administrations, a single 300-microgram dose is sufficient. However, when fetomaternal hemorrhage exceeds 30 mL of whole blood, additional doses are required. The blood bank possesses unique expertise in:

- **Rosette Testing**: Screening for significant FMH (>10 mL)
- **Kleihauer-Betke Testing**: Quantifying fetal hemoglobin in maternal blood
- **Flow Cytometry**: More accurate FMH quantification
- **Dose Calculation**: Using the formula (% HbF × 5000)/30 + 1 = number of vials

These calculations are not straightforward pharmaceutical dosing—they require interpretation of specialized laboratory tests that only transfusion medicine professionals routinely perform.

### Patient Safety Data: Evidence of Risk

Real-world safety data supports blood bank management. A study examining 29,801 deliveries across two major health systems found that **17 eligible patients missed their RhIG doses**, representing a 0.8% miss rate. Root cause analysis identified:

<!-- VIZ: bar-chart - Root Causes of Missed RhIG Administration
DATA:
- Missing orders: 5 cases
- Communication barriers: 4 cases
- Documentation gaps: 4 cases
- Workflow complexity: 4 cases
SOURCE: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9563491/
-->

Critically, when blood bank oversight was bypassed or communication between departments failed, errors occurred. The implementation of an Electronic Health Record toolkit with blood bank integration achieved a **100% administration rate**—eliminating missed doses entirely.

Professional forums document additional safety concerns when pharmacy holds RhIG stock:

- ED and OR staff ordering without completed Type and Screen
- Clinicians bypassing established protocols
- Duplicate administration due to lack of integrated tracking
- Inappropriate dosing without FMH testing

> "Multiple documented cases of inappropriate ordering when pharmacy holds stock." — PathLabTalk Forum Discussion

### Integration with Quality Systems

Blood banks operate under rigorous quality management systems designed for blood products:

- **Traceability**: Lot numbers linked to patient records
- **Temperature Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring with alarm systems
- **Hemovigilance**: Reporting systems for adverse events
- **Medical Director Oversight**: Physician review of all transfusion medicine activities

These systems are already in place and optimized for products like RhIG. Pharmacy systems, while robust for traditional medications, may not provide equivalent integration with transfusion medicine workflows.

## The Case for Pharmacy Management

### Classification Arguments

Proponents of pharmacy management cite RhIG's classification:

- **Blood Derivative**: Manufactured through plasma fractionation, similar to IVIG and albumin
- **Medication Definition**: Falls under Joint Commission medication management standards
- **Consistency**: Other plasma derivatives (clotting factors, IVIG) are typically managed by pharmacy

This approach aligns with how other plasma-derived products are handled in most hospitals and may simplify inventory management across product categories.

### Operational Considerations

Some institutions cite operational advantages of pharmacy management:

- **24/7 Staffing**: Pharmacy may have more consistent overnight coverage
- **Inventory Systems**: Integration with hospital medication dispensing systems
- **Workload Distribution**: May reduce blood bank staffing burden
- **State Requirements**: Some state pharmacy boards may require oversight of all medications

## The Recommended Approach: The Hybrid Model

Based on the evidence, the optimal approach combines blood bank clinical oversight with institutional flexibility:

### Core Principles

1. **Blood Bank Controls Clinical Decision-Making**
   - All testing (Type and Screen, cord blood, FMH) performed by blood bank
   - Eligibility verification by blood bank staff
   - Dose calculations for large FMH by blood bank
   - Documentation on standardized control forms

2. **Flexible Dispensing Options**
   - **Option A** (Recommended): Blood bank stores and dispenses directly
   - **Option B**: Pharmacy dispenses ONLY upon receiving completed blood bank verification forms

3. **Non-Negotiable Safety Checkpoints**
   - NO RhIG released without completed Type and Screen
   - Verification of Rh-negative maternal status
   - Confirmation of Rh-positive infant (for postpartum administration)
   - Review for existing anti-D antibodies
   - FMH testing for all postpartum patients

<!-- VIZ: decision-tree - Patient Eligibility Decision Tree for RhIG

5. If postpartum: Is FMH >30mL? (Yes → Calculate additional doses, No → Standard dose)
6. Dispense appropriate dose

### Implementation Recommendations

**For Blood Bank Directors:**
- Establish written policy per AABB Standard 5.30
- Create standardized RhIG control forms
- Implement Type and Screen verification checkpoints
- Train staff on FMH testing and dose calculations
- Maintain lot number traceability

**For Pharmacy Directors:**
- If RhIG is pharmacy-managed, establish formal agreement with blood bank
- Never dispense without completed blood bank verification
- Ensure communication pathways for testing results
- Consider transitioning inventory to blood bank

**For Hospital Administrators:**
- Audit current RhIG management for safety gaps
- Ensure interdepartmental communication protocols
- Support blood bank staffing for 24/7 RhIG availability
- Review Joint Commission survey history for compliance

All FDA-licensed RhIG products are considered interchangeable for prophylaxis purposes, though some have additional indications (such as WinRho for immune thrombocytopenic purpura). During shortages, institutions should be prepared to substitute available products as needed.

## Key Takeaways

- **AABB Standards explicitly require** the transfusion service to maintain RhIG policies—this is not optional for accredited blood banks
- **Type and Screen verification** must occur before RhIG dispensing, making blood bank involvement essential regardless of storage location
- **The Joint Commission does NOT mandate** either blood bank or pharmacy management—institutions have flexibility
- **Patient safety data** demonstrates risks when blood bank oversight is bypassed
- **A hybrid model** with blood bank clinical control and flexible dispensing offers the best balance of safety and operational efficiency
- **Missed RhIG prophylaxis** should be treated as a "never event" given the potential for devastating consequences

## Conclusion

The question of whether RhoGAM should be housed in the blood bank or pharmacy is ultimately a question of patient safety. While regulatory frameworks allow institutional flexibility, the scientific evidence strongly supports **blood bank management** as the safer and more effective approach.

The AABB Standards are explicit: the transfusion service "shall" have a policy for RhIG prophylaxis and "shall ensure" appropriate dosing. The mandatory testing requirements—Type and Screen, antibody screening, cord blood typing, and FMH quantification—are core blood bank functions. Patient safety data shows that bypassing blood bank oversight leads to errors.

The Joint Commission's classification of RhIG as a "blood derivative" does not mandate pharmacy management—it simply means institutions can choose their approach. But choosing should be guided by evidence, not administrative convenience.

For healthcare professionals, hospital administrators, and accreditation surveyors, the message is clear: **RhIG is safest when managed by the blood bank**, with appropriate policies, testing protocols, and documentation systems in place. The 10,000 lives saved annually by RhIG depend on getting this right.

> "Pharmacists can play an essential role in ensuring the safe administration of these products by guiding clinicians on the use and timing of RhIG therapy." — NCBI StatPearls

This statement acknowledges the pharmacist's role—but note that it speaks to "guiding clinicians," not to physically storing and dispensing the product. The collaborative model, with blood bank oversight and interdisciplinary support, represents the evidence-based best practice for RhIG management.
