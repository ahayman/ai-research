# Research Notes: Complete Guide to US Presidential Terms

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive research covers all 47 presidential terms in United States history, from George Washington's inauguration in 1789 to Donald Trump's second term beginning in 2025. The research includes detailed information about each presidential term including dates, political parties, vice presidents, major accomplishments, historical events, controversies, popularity assessments, and personal details about each president.

The United States has had 45 individuals serve as president across 47 presidencies (Grover Cleveland and Donald Trump each served non-consecutive terms). Eight presidents died in office (four by assassination, four by natural causes), and one resigned. The presidency has evolved from George Washington's precedent-setting administration to the modern executive office we know today.
