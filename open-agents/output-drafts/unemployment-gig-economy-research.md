# Research Notes: Unemployment, Job Creation, and the Gig Economy in America

## Executive Summary

The American labor market is undergoing a fundamental transformation as traditional employment metrics increasingly fail to capture the true state of work in the United States. While the official unemployment rate (U-3) hovers around 4.4% as of September 2025, broader measures that include discouraged workers and those working part-time for economic reasons (U-6) paint a more concerning picture at 7.5%.

The gig economy has emerged as a critical but often invisible component of the labor market. With an estimated 76.4 million Americans participating in freelance or gig work, and 15% of those classified as "unemployed" or "not in the labor force" actually performing gig work, official statistics significantly undercount actual employment. However, this phenomenon comes with profound implications: gig workers earn only 50-65% of their previous traditional wages, lack access to healthcare and retirement benefits, and face significant economic vulnerability.

As job creation has slowed dramatically in 2025 (averaging just 62,000 jobs per month in recent quarters, down from 166,000 in 2024), and over 1 million layoffs have been announced, more Americans are turning to platforms like Uber, DoorDash, and Instacart as a safety net. This shift raises fundamental questions about the quality of work, the erosion of the middle class, and America's economic resilience.

## Historical Context

### Evolution of Employment Measurement
The Current Population Survey (CPS) was designed in the 1930s-40s to measure employment during an era of traditional 8-hour factory or office shifts. The survey methodology has struggled to adapt to the fluid, platform-based work arrangements of the 21st century. [Source: https://www.bostonfed.org/publications/six-hundred-atlantic/season/six/gig-workers-are-undercounted-or-unseen.aspx]

### Rise of the Gig Economy
- 2020: 13.6 million full-time independents (8.2% of workforce)
- 2024: 27.7 million full-time independents (16.7% of workforce)
- Growth driven primarily by ridesharing and delivery platforms (Uber, Lyft, DoorDash)
[Source: https://hellopebl.com/resources/blog/gig-economy-statistics/]

### Platform Growth
- Uber revenue 2024: $43.9 billion (+17.96% YoY) [Source: https://hellopebl.com/resources/blog/gig-economy-statistics/]
- DoorDash revenue 2024: $10.72 billion (+24% YoY) [Source: https://hellopebl.com/resources/blog/gig-economy-statistics/]
- DoorDash cumulative Dashers: 13 million since launch [Source: https://dasher.doordash.com/en-us/blog/gig-economy-statistics]

## Current State

### Labor Market Cooling (2025)
- Job creation has slowed dramatically: 62,000 average monthly jobs in Q3 2025 vs 166,000 in 2024
- Unemployment rising: 4.4% (September 2025) vs 3.7% (January 2024)
- Over 1 million layoffs announced through October 2025
- Federal workforce reduced by 97,000 since January 2025

### Gig Economy as Safety Net
- Workers are "quietly turning to Uber and DoorDash to fill the income gap"
- Goldman Sachs: Gig hours increased most where traditional payroll growth slowed
- 90% of DoorDash workers work fewer than 10 hours/week (supplementary income)
- Uber reports record number of active earners

### Hidden Unemployment
- 15% of those counted as "unemployed" or "not in labor force" are doing gig work
- 5.9 million people want a job but aren't counted as unemployed
- U-6 (7.5%) nearly double the official U-3 rate (4.2%)

## Expert Perspectives

> "It allows people to search longer for their next job. If they are laid off, they have more of a safety cushion beyond unemployment insurance and relying on family and friends and their savings." - Erica Groshen, former Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics [Source: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/americas-labor-market-is-cooling-and-workers-are-quietly-turning-to-uber-and-doordash-to-fill-the-income-gap-100056832.html]

> "The Current Population Survey was designed way back in the '30s and '40s to see if we had enough manpower to beat Hitler. Back then, jobs were typically eight-hour factory or office shifts. The jobs were not as fluid as today—there were no Uber drivers or internet-based tasks for pay." - Chris Foote, Boston Fed labor economist [Source: https://www.bostonfed.org/publications/six-hundred-atlantic/season/six/gig-workers-are-undercounted-or-unseen.aspx]

## Controversies & Debates

### Are Gig Workers Employees or Contractors?
- Companies argue most workers prefer independent contractor status
- Critics argue this classification deprives workers of fundamental rights
- California Proposition 22: Maintained contractor status with some benefits
- Various states exploring "portable benefits" solutions

### Does Gig Work Help or Hurt Workers?
**Pro:**
- Provides flexibility and income during job transitions
- Reduces reliance on unemployment insurance
- 70% of independent contractors say they work as contractors by choice

**Con:**
- Earnings 50-65% of traditional wages
- Lack of benefits, healthcare, retirement
- Income volatility and insecurity
- Shifts economic risk from employers to workers

### Does Gig Economy Mask True Unemployment?
- Official statistics significantly undercount gig participation
- Many gig workers don't consider themselves "employed"
- Creates illusion of lower unemployment than actual underemployment

### Impact on Middle Class
- Income inequality exacerbated by self-employment for low/middle-wage workers
- Treasury: Gig workers average $37,000 vs firm partners at $243,000
- 80% of primary gig workers can't cover unexpected $1,000 expense

## Research Gaps

- Precise data on how many layoff victims specifically turn to gig work (estimates vary widely)
- Long-term outcomes for workers who transition to gig economy
- Regional variations in gig economy participation and earnings
- Impact of AI and automation on future gig work availability
- Mental health outcomes for gig workers vs traditional employees
