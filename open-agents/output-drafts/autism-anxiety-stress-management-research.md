# Research Notes: Anxiety and Stress Management Methods for People with Autism

## Executive Summary

This research compiles evidence-based, non-pharmacological methods for managing anxiety and stress in people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The research draws from systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and randomized controlled trials published in peer-reviewed journals.

---

## 1. Prevalence of Anxiety in Autism

### Key Statistics

- **40-80%** of autistic individuals experience anxiety disorders at some point in their lives
- **39.6%** pooled prevalence rate for anxiety across 32 countries (systematic review)
- **72%** of children with ASD have at least one co-occurring psychiatric condition
- **45.7%** of U.S. children with ASD have comorbid anxiety disorder (2020-2021 National Survey of Children's Health)
- Adults with ASD without intellectual disability have **3x higher risk** of anxiety disorders compared to general population

## 2. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) - Modified for Autism

### Evidence Level: STRONG

### Overview
CBT is the most researched psychological intervention for anxiety in autistic individuals. Modified versions account for sensory, communication, and cognitive differences.

### Research Findings
- Multiple systematic reviews confirm CBT effectiveness for anxiety reduction in ASD
- Modifications essential for success include:
  - Visual supports and written materials
  - Concrete language (reduced metaphors/abstract concepts)
  - Incorporation of special interests
  - Extended session length
  - Increased structure and predictability
  - Sensory environment adaptations
  - Parent/caregiver involvement

### Recommended Duration
- Programs of **8+ weeks** recommended
- **9-16 weeks** yields optimal benefits

## 4. Sensory-Based Interventions

### Evidence Level: MODERATE

### A. Deep Pressure Therapy / Weighted Blankets

#### Research Findings
- 60% reduction in anxiety observed in hospitalized adults using weighted blankets
- Increases parasympathetic nervous system activity (calming)
- Boosts oxytocin levels in individuals with ASD
- Improved sleep initiation and ability to relax
- Individual response varies significantly - 6 of 13 ASD students showed significant benefits

#### Mechanism
- Deep pressure touch influences reticular formation and autonomic nervous system
- Predictable pressure (vs. unpredictable social touch) is better tolerated
- Sensory integration theory supports calming effects

### B. Sensory Regulation Classroom Strategies

#### Research Findings (RCT, 36 classrooms)
- **49%** of students in sensory intervention group showed clinically meaningful anxiety reduction (vs. 27% control)
- Off-task behavior decreased by **21%**
- Meltdown frequency decreased significantly
- **38%** of anxiety reduction explained by improved sensory modulation

#### Key Components
- Environmental zoning with calm corners
- Scheduled proprioceptive/vestibular "sensory-diet" breaks
- Visual interoceptive self-monitoring tools
- Steady-state noise dampening
- Movement-integrated transition routines

## 10. Neurofeedback/Biofeedback

### Evidence Level: EMERGING (Limited)

### Research Findings
- Meta-analysis combining 5 studies showed superior effect vs. control for reducing ASD symptoms
- 42 autistic children study: decreased theta/beta ratio, improved cognitive functions
- Auxiliary improvements in social, thought, and attention domains
- Can reduce co-occurring anxiety, depression symptoms

### Cautions
- Limited high-quality RCTs available
- Expensive and time-consuming
- Should not replace evidence-based treatments (ABA, medication management, etc.)
- Benefits may not be long-lasting
- More rigorous research needed

### Sources
- [Efficacy of neurofeedback as a treatment modality for children in the autistic spectrum](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7889708/)

## 11. Interoception Training

### Evidence Level: EMERGING

### Overview
Interoception refers to awareness of internal body states (heartbeat, breathing, hunger, etc.). Many autistic individuals have altered interoceptive awareness, which may contribute to anxiety.

### Interventions Being Studied
- Kelly Mahler's "Interoception Curriculum"
- Body-based mindfulness approaches
- Heartbeat detection training
- Biofeedback techniques

### Connection to Anxiety
- Difficulties identifying/interpreting bodily signals leads to emotional dysregulation
- Often co-occurs with alexithymia (difficulty identifying emotions)
- Intolerance of uncertainty may mediate link between sensory processing and anxiety

### Sources
- [Emotion Regulation: Concepts & Practice in Autism Spectrum Disorder](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3830422/)
- [Sensory Sensitivity and Intolerance of Uncertainty](https://public-pages-files-2025.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.731753/pdf)

### Key Strategies

#### Lighting
- Reduce fluorescent lighting (can trigger sensory stress)
- Use natural light or dimmable LEDs
- Minimize harsh overhead lighting

#### Acoustics
- Sound-absorbing materials
- Quiet zones/areas
- Noise reduction strategies
- Steady-state noise dampening

#### Visual Environment
- Neutral, calming colors

## Treatment Recommendations from Research

1. **Personalization is critical** - autism is heterogeneous; what works varies by individual
2. **Multimodal approaches** often more effective than single interventions
3. **Minimum 8 weeks** for intervention programs; 9-16 weeks optimal
4. **Modifications essential** for standard therapies (CBT, mindfulness)
5. **Address sensory needs** as foundational component
6. **Include support persons** (parents, caregivers) when possible
7. **Consider co-occurring conditions** (ADHD, depression, etc.)
8. **Regular assessment** of intervention effectiveness
