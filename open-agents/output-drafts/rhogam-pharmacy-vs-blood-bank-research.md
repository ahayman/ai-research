# Research Notes: Should RhoGAM Be Housed in Pharmacy or Blood Bank?

## Executive Summary

The question of whether RhoGAM (Rh immune globulin/RhIG) should be housed in the hospital pharmacy or blood bank is a significant operational and regulatory issue that affects patient safety. Based on comprehensive research of regulatory requirements, professional standards, and scientific evidence, **the blood bank is the recommended location for RhIG storage and dispensing, though this is not a regulatory mandate**.

The key findings support blood bank management because:
1. **Type and Screen verification is required** before RhIG dispensing - a core blood bank function
2. **AABB Standards explicitly require** the transfusion service to have a policy for RhIG prophylaxis
3. **Patient safety data** shows that blood bank oversight prevents administration errors
4. **FMH testing and dosing calculations** require blood bank expertise
5. **Traceability requirements** align with blood bank quality systems

However, the Joint Commission classifies RhIG as a "blood derivative" (not a blood component), which places it in either medication management OR immunohematology standards - neither is mandated. Many institutions successfully use a hybrid model where the blood bank controls eligibility verification and dosing while pharmacy may handle inventory.

## Key Facts & Statistics

- Approximately 50% of US AABB-accredited institutions may not have comprehensive RhIG policies [Source: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38534065/]

### Joint Commission Classification
- RhIG is classified as a "blood derivative," NOT a blood component [Source: https://www.pathlabtalk.com/forum/topic/4804-rhogamrhophylac-must-be-under-pharmacy-control/]
- As a blood derivative, it is defined as a "medication" per Joint Commission definition
- Official JC position (Megan Sawchuk): "No, this is NOT a mandatory practice" - hospitals may manage under either Immunohematology OR Medication Management standards [Source: https://www.pathlabtalk.com/forum/topic/4804-rhogamrhophylac-must-be-under-pharmacy-control/]
- JC surveys under EITHER set of standards depending on departmental oversight

### Patient Safety Data
- Study of 29,801 deliveries: 17 missed RhIG doses (0.8% of eligible patients) across two health systems [Source: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9563491/]
- Root causes: Missing orders, communication barriers, documentation gaps, workflow complexity
- Electronic Health Record toolkit achieved 100% administration rate after implementation [Source: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36275497/]
- Researchers recommend missed prophylaxis should be a "never event"

### Efficacy of RhIG Prophylaxis
- Prior to RhIG introduction (1968): HDFN incidence ~1% of pregnancies with 50% mortality rate [Source: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9824959/]
- Post-introduction: 80-90% decline in Rh-hemolytic disease incidence [Source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK560488/]
- Combined antenatal and postpartum prophylaxis is ~99% effective at preventing maternal sensitization [Source: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0235807]

## Historical Context

## Regulatory Framework Analysis

### FDA Classification
- **Regulatory Body**: Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER)
- **Product Type**: Plasma-derived biologic product
- **License Type**: Biologics License Application (BLA)
- **CFR Reference**: 21 CFR Part 640 Subpart J - Immune Globulin (Human)
- RhIG is NOT classified under 21 CFR Part 606 (blood and blood components) but under Part 640 (plasma derivatives)

### Storage Requirements per FDA (21 CFR 640)
- Globulin containing alcohol or >5% moisture: stored at -10°C or lower
- Solid globulin free from alcohol and <5% moisture: stored at 0°C or lower
- Processing: Never exposed to temperatures above 45°C
- After sterilization: Not exposed above 32°C for more than 72 hours
- **Clinical storage**: 2-8°C (refrigerated) per manufacturer guidelines

### Blood Bank vs Pharmacy Storage Standards

**Blood Bank Storage (per AABB/FDA):**
- RHIG is refrigerated while in the blood bank (2-8°C)
- Should be kept at ambient temperature when dispensed to floor
- Continuous temperature monitoring required
- Must be administered promptly after patient identity confirmation [Source: https://www.utmb.edu/lsg2/Home/Details?id=916]

**Pharmacy Storage:**
- Same temperature requirements (2-8°C)
- Falls under medication storage standards
- May require different documentation systems

### Traceability Requirements

**ISBT 128 Standard:**
- ISBT 128 defines Plasma Derivatives (including RhIG) as products for which ABO blood groups is not relevant [Source: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5757578/]
- Recommendation: RhIG should be labeled with GS1 bar codes (not ISBT 128) since ABO is not relevant
- However, lot number traceability is still required
- Donation identification numbers ensure 100-year global uniqueness [Source: https://www.isbtweb.org/resource/tb-004-isbt-128-and-traceability-v1-1-0-pdf.html]

**Blood Bank Traceability:**
- Type and Screen results linked to patient
- FMH testing documentation
- Lot number tracking
- Administration verification
- Hemovigilance reporting capability

## Arguments FOR Blood Bank Management

### 1. Testing Requirements
- **Type and Screen REQUIRED** before RhIG release [Source: https://www.utmb.edu/lsg2/Home/Details?id=916]
- Blood bank has direct access to Rh typing results
- Cord blood testing performed by blood bank to determine infant Rh status
- Antibody screening identifies already-sensitized patients (ineligible for RhIG)

### 2. Dosing Expertise
- FMH testing (Rosette test, Kleihauer-Betke, flow cytometry) performed by blood bank
- Standard 300 mcg dose covers 15 mL fetal RBCs (30 mL whole blood)
- Complex dose calculations for large FMH require blood bank expertise [Source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430876/]
- Formula: (% HbF x 5000)/30 + 1 = number of vials

### 3. Patient Safety
- Blood bank can verify patient eligibility before release
- Prevents administration to:
  - Rh-positive patients
  - Already sensitized patients (with anti-D)
  - Mothers of Rh-negative infants
- Multiple documented cases of inappropriate ordering when pharmacy holds stock [Source: https://www.pathlabtalk.com/forum/topic/4804-rhogamrhophylac-must-be-under-pharmacy-control/]

### 4. AABB Accreditation
- AABB Standards explicitly assign RhIG policy to transfusion service
- Blood bank medical director oversight for Rh-positive transfusions to Rh-negative patients
- Integration with existing blood bank quality systems

### 5. Error Prevention
- ED/OR staff may order without required preliminary testing if pharmacy holds stock
- Clinicians may bypass established protocols
- Blood bank serves as safety checkpoint
- Documentation integrated with transfusion medicine records

## Arguments FOR Pharmacy Management

### 1. Classification as Medication
- Joint Commission classifies as "blood derivative" = medication
- Consistent with how other plasma derivatives are handled (IVIG, albumin, clotting factors)
- Falls under standard medication management systems

### 2. State Pharmacy Board Requirements
- Some states may require pharmacy oversight of all medications
- Pharmaceutical distribution regulations may apply

### 3. Inventory Management
- Pharmacy systems may have better inventory tracking for medications
- Integration with hospital medication dispensing systems

### 4. Staffing Considerations
- 24/7 pharmacy availability in some settings
- May reduce blood bank workload

## Recommended Best Practice: Hybrid Model

Based on the evidence, the optimal approach combines blood bank clinical oversight with efficient dispensing:

### Model Components:
1. **Blood Bank Performs:**
   - Type and Screen verification
   - Cord blood typing of newborn
   - FMH testing when indicated
   - Dose calculation for large hemorrhages
   - Patient eligibility verification
   - Documentation on control form

2. **Dispensing Options:**
   - **Option A**: Blood bank dispenses directly (most common)
   - **Option B**: Pharmacy dispenses ONLY upon receiving completed blood bank control form

3. **Documentation:**
   - Lot number tracking
   - Patient identification verification
   - Administration timing (within 72 hours of exposure)
   - Results reported to transfusion medicine

### Key Safety Checkpoints:
- NO RhIG released without completed Type and Screen
- Verification of Rh-negative maternal status
- Confirmation of Rh-positive infant (postpartum)
- Review for existing anti-D antibodies
- FMH testing for postpartum patients

## Expert Perspectives

> "RhoGAM/RhoPhylac must be under the control of pharmacy because RhoGam/RhoPhylac is a blood derivative, not a blood component such as blood, FFP, etc., and as such is defined as a medication per the JC definition." - Joint Commission surveyor claim

> "No, this is NOT a mandatory practice. Rho Immune Globulin is a 'blood derivative'... [JC] surveys these products under EITHER Immunohematology standards OR Medication Management standards." - Megan Sawchuk, Joint Commission representative [Source: https://www.pathlabtalk.com/forum/topic/4804-rhogamrhophylac-must-be-under-pharmacy-control/]

> "Pharmacists can play an essential role in ensuring the safe administration of these products by guiding clinicians on the use and timing of RhIG therapy." - NCBI StatPearls [Source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557884/]

> "Given the serious nature of Rh-alloimmunization, researchers believe missed prophylaxis should be a 'never event.'" - PMC Study [Source: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9563491/]

## Controversies & Debates

### The "Blood Derivative" Debate
- **Pharmacy argument**: RhIG is a plasma derivative, manufactured through fractionation, should be treated as a medication
- **Blood bank argument**: Administration requires pretransfusion testing, involves blood group antigen exposure prevention, should be treated as transfusion medicine

### Regulatory Ambiguity
- No clear FDA, Joint Commission, or CMS mandate for either location
- AABB Standards clearly place responsibility with transfusion service
- Institutional flexibility allows for various models
- Some JC surveyors have incorrectly stated pharmacy management is required

### Risk of Errors
- **Pharmacy management risks**: Orders without Type and Screen, wrong patient identification, inappropriate dosing
- **Blood bank management challenges**: After-hours availability, workflow delays, communication with ordering providers

## Research Gaps

1. **Limited peer-reviewed studies** directly comparing blood bank vs pharmacy management outcomes
2. **No randomized controlled trials** evaluating safety differences between management models
3. **State-by-state regulatory requirements** not comprehensively documented
4. **Cost-effectiveness data** lacking for different management models
5. **International comparison data** limited for US applicability
6. **Long-term outcomes** of missed doses not well characterized
7. **Electronic health record integration** best practices not standardized

## Conclusion

The scientific and regulatory evidence supports **blood bank management** of RhoGAM as the preferred model, primarily because:

1. **AABB Standards explicitly require** the transfusion service to maintain RhIG policies
2. **Type and Screen verification** must occur before dispensing - a core blood bank function
3. **FMH testing and dose calculations** require blood bank laboratory expertise
4. **Patient safety data** demonstrates risks when blood bank oversight is bypassed
5. **Traceability** integrates better with transfusion medicine quality systems

However, this is **not a regulatory mandate**. The Joint Commission allows either blood bank or pharmacy management, and successful hybrid models exist. The key requirement is that **appropriate testing and verification occur before administration**, regardless of which department holds the physical inventory.

Institutions should establish policies that ensure:
- Type and Screen before release
- Verification of patient eligibility (Rh-negative, not sensitized)
- Appropriate dosing based on FMH testing
- Proper documentation and traceability
- Medical director oversight of transfusion medicine aspects
